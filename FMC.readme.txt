look in the section "Parameter Development for the Flavin Cofactor" for more details. 
notes: this is the flavin portion only and is intended to be linked to a Cys residue through the SG atom in CYX. Make sure to add the bond between FMC C4A and CYX SG in your system building.
you will also need to load the GAFF2 libraries during setup.
